## 2.0 The perspective

The perspective is a tecnique to represent on a plane a tridimensional object.  
Lines that in 3D are parallel (usually apart vertical ones) meet in the 2D plane in a so called _vanishing-point_. Those vanishing points line on the same line, called _horizon_.  

## 2.1 The coordinates transformations

We will build models and move them, do all the math in 3D and each time we want to "see" it on our screen we will need to run:  

1) a viewing transformation  
    from World coordinates (x<sub>w</sub>, y<sub>w</sub>, z<sub>w</sub>) 
    into Eye coordinates (x<sub>e</sub>, y<sub>e</sub>, z<sub>e</sub>)

2) a perspective transformation  
    from eye coordinates (x<sub>e</sub>, y<sub>e</sub>, z<sub>e</sub>)  
    into screen coordinates (X, Y)

#### 2.1.1 the viewing transformation

The first transformation we need to compute in the one that changes the coordinate system from the world into a coordinate system having its origin in the our eye (one for the moment), the point of view, or camera. I'll refer to that point with the E letter.

On the left you can see the world coordinate system, it will likely contain something we want to render in 2D, for the moment let's assume it is just a cube. Another very important element is the observer, our eye.

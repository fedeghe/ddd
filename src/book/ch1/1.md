### 1.1: Coordinates and logical coordinates  

In _math_ almost all the numerical results will be similar to rational numbers (indeed a computer can only have finite decimal digits). The native methods available for us to draw on the canvas though accepts only integers; those parameters are exactly the coordinates of our points in the coordinates system of the canvas. This system has the origin in the top left of the screen, the x-axis is horizontal pointing toward the right and they-axis is vertical pointing toward the bottom.

We need then to change the coordinate system into one we all feel more comfortable to draw in.


``` js 
var width = 800,
    height = 600;
    // we'll do that more properly with a matrix
    // here we do that by hand
    renderable = ({x, y}) => ({
        x: x - width/2,    // traslate
        y: - y + height/2  // invert and traslate
    }); 
```

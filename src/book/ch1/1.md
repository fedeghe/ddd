### 1.1: Coordinates and logical coordinates  

In _math_ almost all the numerical results will be similar to rational numbers (indeed a computer can only have finite decimal digits). The native methods available for us to draw on the canvas though accepts only integers; those parameters are exactly the coordinates of our points in the coordinates system of the canvas. This system has the origin in the top left of the screen, the x-axis is horizontal pointing toward the right and they-axis is vertical pointing toward the bottom.

This means to draw a line we have to that this coordinate system into account

```
          A     B
drawLine(6,2, 10,6).  // watch the canvas does NOT provide that, we will in out simple library
```

the truth is that to draw a line in the canvas we have to write something like:

``` js
ctx.beginPath();   // Start a path
ctx.moveTo(6, 2);  // Move to initial point
ctx.lineTo(10, 6); // Draw a line to (10, 6)
ctx.stroke();      // Render
```

but we can create out own `drawLine` function to do that.  
Another more important thing is to change the coordinate system into one we all feel more comfortable to draw in.

``` js 
var width = 800,
    height = 600;
    renderable = ({x, y}) => ({
        x,
        y: height - y
    }); 
```

### 1.0: The Canvas  

The `canvas` is an html5 tag introduced by  (no it's not a typo) in 2004 and then _quickly_ adopted and available in every browser as standard core feature (2008).  
It provides a bitmap-based area on the browser allowing to draw programmatically shapes, graphics and more. This was the demise of macromedia Flash.  

Start from a canvas tag in a html document `<canvas id="myCanvas"></canvas>`. That's all the markup we need in that book.

### 1.2 Before jumping into the rabbit's hole  

At that point the book could take the annoying path of introducing all what is needed to dive directly into the engine.  
A non exaustive list would at least contain a decent overview on mapping modes, basic algebra and applied geometry, 3 points orientation, area of a polygon, point in triangle test, point in polygon test, point on line test, point line distance, point on line projection, triangulation of a polygon, basic matrix theory (linear transformation and their composition, inversions, translations, rotations, homogeneous coordinates, change of base), some very classic algorithms (Beizer curves, b-spline fitting, Cohen-Sutherland line clipping, Bresenham's Algorithm for line drawing, Sutherland-Hodgman Polygon Clipping). You knot that sense when you prepare the luggare for a journeyaand you are sure you forgot something? That's me here now! Not a big deal anyway since "All chickens come home to roost" right? Absolutely yes
    
I'll assume you know or you are motivated enough to read quickly about it and get familiar with those topics, AI wont help you.

So without further ado, let's jump into the _perspective_ topic.

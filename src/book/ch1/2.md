### 1.2: Before jumping the the rabbit's hole  

At that point the book could take the annoying path of introducing all what is needed to dive directly into the engine:  
- mapping modes  
- basic algebra and applied geometry. 
- 3 points orientation. 
- area of a polygon
- point in triangle test
- point in polygon test
- point on line test
- point line distance
- point on line projection
- triangulation of a polygon
- basic matrix theory:
  - linear transformation
  - inversions, translations, rotations
  - homogeneous coordinates
  - rotations
  - change of base
- some very classic algorithms:
  - Beizer curves
  - b-spline fitting
  - Cohen-Sutherland line clipping
  - Bresenham's Algorithm for line drawing
  - Sutherland-Hodgman Polygon Clipping
  
but, I will NOT.  
I'll assume you know. The code will be there on the library for you to use (and check).

So without further ado, let jump into the _perspective_ topic.
